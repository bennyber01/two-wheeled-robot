GP2D12 F 9Z
Sharp IR GP2Y0A21YK0F has the same distance range as a GP2D12

R = (2914/(V+5))-1

voltage= arduino_inp * 5 / 1023
Distance = (1/voltage) – 0.42

Using curve fitting in MATLAB we get:
D(v) =  1.5290*V^4−13.7043*V^3+52.5578*V^2+112.8212*V+120.3399
where:
D(v): Distance as a function of output voltage
V    : Output voltage


2D120X F 1Z
dist = (12.285/(voltage-0.097))-.42
